Problem 1
=========

``` r
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
homcide = read.csv( file = "./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Modifiy victim\_race to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category. Be sure that victim\_age is numeric.

### data cleaning

``` r
homcide= homcide%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, ",", state))%>%
  subset(!city_state %in% c("Dallas,TX","Phoenix,AZ","Kansas City,MO","Tulsa,AL"))%>%
  mutate(victim_race = ifelse(victim_race != "White", "non-white", "white"))%>%
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age), victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white"))
```
